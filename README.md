# CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK FOR BREAST CANCER CLASSIFICATION

# Problem Statement 1
Convolution Neural Network based classiâ€€er
model is build so as to classify the mammograms as Benign, Malignant or
healthy person.This model just simply implements direct mammograms of
benign,malignant and healthy people without any pre-processing.
Input : mammogram of size 1024 X 1024 pixels
Output : Benign ,malignant,or healthy person.

# Problem Statement 2
Preprocessing the benign and malignant mam-
mograms to build a CNN model. This process cannot preprocess the healthy
patient mammogram as they donot have any lesions.
Input : 1024 x 1024 pixel Mammogram image.
Output: 8 images each of size depending on radius of the lesion.

# Problem Statement 3
Build a CNN model to classify benign or ma-
lignant using preprocessed images. Compare the accuracies of CNN models
without image pre-processing and with image pre-processing.
Input : Pre-processed mammograms
Output: Benign, malignant.
